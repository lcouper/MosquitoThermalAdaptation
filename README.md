## Projects ##

#### 1. Investigating current patterns of thermal adaptation 
Working doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xFx6vmBDdw5-maTafi-_qo3OfKLJdVki4uI07BEJNdA/edit  
1. What life history traits are most limiting to fitness? (sensitivity analysis of fitness calculations to trait inputs as in Mordecai et al 2017 (see supplementals)? or just look at which traits have lowest TPC parameters)
3. How does Topt of fitness correspond to source environment? 
4. What aspects of temperature are strongest drivers of adaptation? (ibutton data)

#### 2. Intra-specific variation in modeling climate responses 
Working doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kU_lWkhXjSKcnZGYVIlGcciu3q279f0bcKXwr3HfMgQ/edit   
1. How do projections of mosquito climate responses vary when using species-wide vs population-level life history trait responses?
2. How do they vary when using iButton vs weather station data vs remotely sensed data?

#### 3. Genetic varaiation and potential for thermal adaptaiton ####
Working doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E3hGLk8f2fVaF-348dDgzJ6As3sVeZl5RvhXSWXEKEI/edit
1. How much within- and between- genetic variation exists between populations? 
2. How much of the variaiton in fitness can be explained by genetics vs the environment?


## Currently working on ##
- finishing thermal performance experiments (4C treatment ongoing)
- fitting TPCs to prelim data using Bayesian methods
- DNA extraction

## Upcoming ##
- calculate fitness for each population & temperature treatment (i.e., probability of surviving to day [x] adult stage x fecundity (proxy based on wing length))
- calculate between-population variation in upper thermal limits for traits 
- pull other temperature data for sites (e.g., max temp in Spring, max temp in wettest quarter)
- wing length measurements & DNA extractions
- Estimate sequencing cost. Decide whether to sequence all individuals or just those with wing length measurements (i.e., those with available fecundity proxies)

### Approximate sample numbers to extract (9/7/22) ###
Refers to adults with complete data (i.e., will be sequenced)
725 in total
