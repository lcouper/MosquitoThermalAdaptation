# Mosquito Thermal Adaptation 

These are the scripts and data used for analysis in the manuscript *"Limited variation in thermal tolerance across the range of a widespread mosquito species"* by Lisa Couper*, Johannah Farner, Kelsey Lyberger, Alexandra Lee, and Erin Mordecai. The manuscript investigates the evidence for mosquito thermal adaptation using *Aedes sierrensis* as a model system.

## File organization 

Scripts and data are organized in the following folders:

**ClimateDataAnalysis**   
- Earth Engine script used to calculate relevant temperature variables from PRISM data
- Raw and compiled data files generated from Earth Engine script 


**Experiment Data**
- R scripts used for data-reshaping and basic statistical analysis (eg., regression models and correlations described in the manuscript)
- Raw and cleaned data files for both the main and validation experiment

**Thermal Performance Curves**
- R scripts used in the Bayesian thermal performance curve models (1 script per trait)
- Cleaned experiment data file used for TPC fitting
