# Mosquito Thermal Adaptation 

These are the scripts and data used for analysis in the manuscript *"Limited variation in thermal tolerance across the range of a widespread mosquito species"* by Lisa Couper*, Johannah Farner, Kelsey Lyberger, Alexandra Lee, and Erin Mordecai. The manuscript investigates the evidence for mosquito thermal adaptation using *Aedes sierrensis* as a model system.
