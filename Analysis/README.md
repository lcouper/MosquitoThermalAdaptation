To generate thermal performance curves, we fit either symmetric, quadratic or asymmetric, Brière functions to the temperature-trait data:

Biting rate (inverse of gonotrophic cycle length (i.e., time between bloodfeed and egg-laying): Briere
Eggs per gonotrophic cycle: Briere
Probability egg to adult survival: Quadratic
Development rate (1/days): Briere
Adult lifespan: Quadratic

Briere: cT(T–T0)(Tm−T)1/2)  
Quadratic: -c(T–T0)(T–Tm))
