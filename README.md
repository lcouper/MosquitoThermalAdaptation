## Projects ##

#### 1. Investigating current patterns of thermal adaptation 
1. What life history traits are most limiting to fitness?
2. How does Topt of fitness correspond to source environment? 
3. What aspects of temperature are strongest drivers of adaptation? (ibutton data)

#### 2. Intra-specific variation in modeling climate responses 
Working doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kU_lWkhXjSKcnZGYVIlGcciu3q279f0bcKXwr3HfMgQ/edit   
1. How do projections of mosquito climate responses vary when using species-wide vs population-level life history trait responses?
2. How do they vary when using iButton vs weather station data vs remotely sensed data?

#### 3. Genetic varaiation and potential for thermal adaptaiton ####
1. How much within- and between- genetic variation exists between populations?
2. Can we identify alleles/genes associated with thermal tolerance? 


## Currently working on ##
- finishing thermal performance experiments (4C treatment ongoing)
- fitting TPCs to prelim data using Bayesian methods
- DNA extraction

## Upcoming ##
- double check data entered correctly & list all individuals still alive / resolve issues in datasheet
- calculate fitness for each population & temperature treatment (i.e., probability of surviving to day [x] adult stage x fecundity (proxy based on wing length))
- pull other temperature data for sites (e.g., max temp in Spring, max temp in wettest quarter)
- fit TPC for fecundity & adult life span
- wing length measurements (do all of these first)
- DNA extractions

### Approximate sample numbers to extract (9/7/22) ###
Refers to adults with complete data (i.e., will be sequenced)
725 in total
