- fitting TPCs to prelim data using Bayesian methods

## Upcoming ##
- DNA extraction & wing length measurements


 ## relevant notes for later ##
"Larval resources and larval density de- termine size at metamorphosis which, in turn, determines number of eggs per batch, female longevity and expected female lifetime fecundity; hence, population growth rate increases with pre-adult nutrition and decreases with density (Hawley 1985a, b; Fisher et al. 1990; Hard and Bradshaw 1993)." from : https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/PL00008891.pdf
