## Projects ##

#### 1. Investigating evidence for mosquito thermal adaptation
Working doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xFx6vmBDdw5-maTafi-_qo3OfKLJdVki4uI07BEJNdA/edit  

1. How much does mosquito thermal performance vary across the species range?   
1a.  How much variation primarily in thermal *limits* or trait performance?  (evidence: for composite fitness measure, calculate variance in peak performance and in thermal limits)     
1b. Is the variation within-, between-population, or both?   (do above for both within (for dev rate, fecundity, and life span traits) and between-populations)     
 
2. How does variation in thermal performance correspond to local (source) climate conditions? With what temperature/climate variables is variation most strongly associated? (evidence: correlations between thermal limits and bioclim variables). Make sure to include extreme temps (i.e., daily maximums) as justified in Sunday et al. 2019

3. Importance of each life history trait (struggling with the right question here)  
3a. What life history traits vary the most? (evidence: for each trait, calcualte between-population variance?)  
3b. What life history traits are most limiting to fitness?  (evidence: sensitivity analysis of fitness calculations to trait inputs as in Mordecai et al 2017 (see supplementals)? or just look at which traits have lowest TPC parameters)  
3c. What life history traits contribute most to local adaptation? (evidence: which show strongest correlation with climatic variable?)  
3d. What life history traits are corrlated with each other/ under selection -- measure correlational selection as in Gilbert 2017 (https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2017.0536#d3e1705)  
Model fitness ~ trait1+ trait2 + trait3 + trait1*trait2   
allows you to estimate correlations between traits




#### 2. Intra-specific variation in modeling climate responses 
Working doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kU_lWkhXjSKcnZGYVIlGcciu3q279f0bcKXwr3HfMgQ/edit   
1. How do projections of mosquito climate responses vary when using species-wide vs population-level life history trait responses?  Evidence/analysis: Use this method of calculating individual pop growth rates (i.e., fitness) from life history trait data:

2. How do they vary when using iButton vs weather station data vs remotely sensed data?

#### 3. Genetic varaiation and potential for thermal adaptaiton ####
Working doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E3hGLk8f2fVaF-348dDgzJ6As3sVeZl5RvhXSWXEKEI/edit
1. How much within- and between- genetic variation exists between populations? 
2. How much of the variaiton in fitness can be explained by genetics vs the environment? (evidence: results from sequencing on % genetic contribution to fitness)
